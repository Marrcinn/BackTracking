# BackTracking
A repository with my backtracking projects

The sudoku-object.py is sudoku solver. I was inspired by a tutorial on youtube (https://youtu.be/tvP_FZ-D9Ng)

The backpack.py is my approach to the knapsack problem. It is fully created by me, with no tutorial, so the approach may be weird, but it works.

I'll probably be working on visualizing these two projects in the near future
